# Switcheo Labs Coding Challenge

Hello there! I'm excited to take on the Switcheo Labs coding challenge. This challenge will put my skills in blockchain development using Cosmos SDK, system design for blockchain API networks, and problem-solving abilities to the test.

## Task 1: Cosmos SDK Blockchain Development

For my first task, I will create a new blockchain using Cosmos SDK and implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) transactions within it.

### Requirements:
- Create a new blockchain network using Cosmos SDK.
- Implement CRUD functionality for transactions.
- Ensure proper validation and handling of transactions.

### My Approach:
I plan to start by setting up the Cosmos SDK environment and then proceed with defining the structure of the blockchain. I will implement the CRUD functionality by creating custom transaction types and handling them within the blockchain logic. Proper validation and error handling will be integrated to ensure the integrity of the transactions.

## Task 2: Blockchain API System Design
For the second task, I will design a system for a blockchain API network, considering scalability, reliability, and efficiency.

### Requirements:
- Design a scalable architecture for a blockchain API network.
- Consider factors like load balancing, fault tolerance, and data consistency.
- Provide an explanation of design choices.

### My Approach:
I will begin by outlining the components of the API network, including load balancers, API gateways, and backend services. I will focus on designing a distributed and fault-tolerant system architecture using microservices. Database choices and caching mechanisms will be considered for data consistency and performance.

## Task 3: Summation Methods
For the final task, I will devise three different methods for conducting summation up to a certain number, ensuring efficiency and scalability.

### Requirements:
- Develop three distinct algorithms for summation.
- Ensure each method is efficient and can handle large numbers.
- Provide a brief explanation of each method's approach.

### My Approach:
I will explore various mathematical approaches to summation, including iterative, recursive, and mathematical formula-based methods. Each method will be optimized for efficiency, considering factors like time complexity and memory usage.

## Evaluation Criteria:
My submission will be evaluated based on:

- **Completion:** Did I complete all tasks outlined in the challenge?
- **Quality:** Is my code well-written, documented, and structured?
- **Efficiency:** Are my solutions efficient and scalable?
- **Clarity:** Is my system design and explanation clear and understandable?

I'm ready to tackle this challenge head-on! If I have any questions along the way, I'll make sure to reach out. Let's dive in and showcase my skills.
